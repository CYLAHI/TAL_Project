Good device, but not for everyone.

To start off, it runs chrome OS, obviously, with the first integration of the playstore. My current internet had trouble connecting but thats hard to tell if thats just my bad internet or something with the device itself. It ran videos smooth and they looked amazing on the high resolution display, so i can definitely offer this a media consumption device, but at a near $500 you look for more. I tried gaming with some android games which for the most part ran smooth and without any hiccups however the touchscreen isn't optimal and it has a lot of resistance when trying to slide your thumb on it, which felt rough and frankly uncomfortable. Typing on this keyboard felt good and i found myself typing up to speed in no time. It has very good travel and a nice curve. Typing documents or essays on this thing would be incredibly doable. The main reason i got this unit was for the built in stylus, which being a samsung galaxy note user for years, caught my eye. It was a good size for me personally, about medium sized hands, and it was comfortable to draw with. Unfortunately most drawing apps didnt have a palm rejection and neither does the chromebook, so when i would rest my hand on the device it would usually start drawing where my hand touched as well. Otherwise it was good to draw with. I sought for a way to get linux or windows on this device but unfortunately it uses an arm chipset, which until later this year when microsoft comes out with a new arm windows that can emulate full software, chrome os is all you'll get.

Overall the device was nice, felt good to hold in the hands and a crisp display. As a secondary media consumption or document writer it makes sense. If you are looking for something to do a bit more, look at other options that can fit your budget, at the end of the day, the limitations of chrome os are too great to keep this as an everyday driver.
