Reading the details on this laptop it definitely seemed like a screaming deal! Unfortunately, I should have paid closer attention to those that were reporting issues with the WiFi as soon as they started using the laptop.\
\
I too received a defective WiFi model that had blazing upload speeds over WiFi (20mbps+) but terrible download speeds no matter what (2-5mbps). We have several other devices on our home WiFi that were working perfectly with no download issues.\
\
After updating drivers and software through Ethernet (Wifi was too slow for any updating) the slow download speeds continued which is why we initiated a return of this laptop.}
