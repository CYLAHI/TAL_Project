Well, writing this is not easy for me.
Somehow i really like my Samsung Chromebook Plus, but it's really suffering from it's slow processor.
Even while typing in google docs you will recognize some stutter or hicups, it become more worse if you insert a picture and try to write around it. I can write pretty fast and there is noticable lag between the key i press and when it appears on the screen.
Switching between some apps also shows serious framerate issues.
The screen is just amazing, the keyboard is ok, the speakers doing their job, trackpack is ok, but as i mentioned, it's performance is just not sufficient for this price tag.
I really recommend purchasing the Chromebook Pro, hopefully this will perform much better.
