I've been a happy Chromebook User for over 3 years -- in fact we have 3 Acer Chromebooks in our family now

After ordering and replacing the Acer R11 -- 3 times by Amazon - I have to say Acer should be ashamed of the poor quality product they put out.

First Unit arrived with defective memory or component -- would not load OS properly and after several failed attempts by Acer and Amazon to retore factory default and re-install Chrome OS the unit was determined DOA and returned for replacement.

Second Unit arrives, microphone would not work -- external microphone was suggested but I declined that as a solution to a brand new piece of equipment.

Third Unit arrived -- with imp[roperly installed OS and was reset with help of Acer CS, however microphone did not work and since I use Google Voice thru the desktop -- I needed a working internal mic........

Amazon was done at 3 attempts and frankly so was I -- the one disappointing aspect of the whole experience is from other user comments the defective MIC is a well documented occurrence and yet a powerful company like Amazon has much better things to do than cleanup and remove products from their site until a manufacturer deals with it. This review is about a 1 star review of the R11 Chromebook -- Amazon did everything right........just short of pulling product from site.........wish they had
