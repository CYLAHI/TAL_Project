I never write reviews but I thought this was important. I love the functionality and features of this Chromebook. It is very fast, has incredible resolution and the battery life is great. The only issue I am having is it drops the wifi connection. I have a dual-band router through Comcast and never have any issues with my phones or desktop. However, when I start to stream a lot of data the wifi connection is lost. The only way to get it back is to reboot. I am a network engineer by trade so I am pretty sure I know what I am doing. I contacted Samsung and they suggested the reboot method as well, but I consider that a workaround and not a solution. I am hoping more people will see this problem and they will instrument a fix.
