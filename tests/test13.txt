If you are familiar with Chrome OS, then this review probably won't help you. I am not familiar with Chrome OS and was shocked to find there is no clear path to any serious art programs, edit programs, or the invisible camera.which can only see you. After 5 days of getting lost I made the correct decision to follow the North Star to get out of there and stay with Microsoft. I do a lot of art and wanted to use the touch screen and pen to broaden my horizons. I am sure there is a way to learn how to navigate this machine but after talking to Amazon, the Geek squad and Samsung who did not know either, it was time to surrender and send the borderline laptop back to its resting place.
