Pros:
-It runs all the android apps that I ve installed without a problem
-The keyboard and the track-pad are fine
-Great battery life
-Charges very fast
-Fast performance
-Good looking machine
-Light
-Great screen

Cons:
-The screen turned off once or twice without a reason
-There is an annoying sound that comes from the speakers from time time to time
-Weak speakers
-MS office apps are not currently supported
To sum up: There is room for improvement but this is a truly innovative laptop. There is no doubt that this is the future. If the compatibility with the office apps returns this laptop can easily replace a pc and certainly a mac, for home and work use.
