After a month with this product, I can honestly say that this WAS a very decent buy, especially at just $350. The specs, performance and visuals are an absolute stunner. The laptop has a very lengthy battery life (around 9 to 10 hours) when fully charged, beautiful 1080p display, and plenty of space with the 1TB hard-drive. Unfortunately though, a vertical blueish-black line began growing upwards the screen, till it eventually reached the top of the screen. It became a distraction, and then it became really annoying.}
