I am a Mac person, my wife isn\'92t. So I needed to find a computer that would last at least 3-4 years for her for under $600. Being a Mac person, it\'92s easy to pick a laptop because of the limitations on choices. PC\'92s are quite different. Out of the box this laptop was functional. The startup took about a minute to load, the Ram was sufficient and that\'92s about it.\
\
Being realistic, I purchased this laptop for the motherboard, the backlit keyboard, the benchmarks and the M.2 slot. That said this laptop easily turns into a beast with minor upgrades. I installed a Samsung 850 EVO - 500GB - M.2 SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-N5E500BW) and a Crucial 4GB Single DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT4G4SFS8213.\
\
I am by no means a techy. I have basic computer skills and relied heavily on YouTube for the how to guides. Since the laptop came with a 1 TB HD, I left that in place and use it as a back up drive or slave drive. The M.2 SSD is the primary and now the laptop loads in less than 10 seconds. The battery being used on \'be level brightness while running Word, Excel, IE, and SPSS tends to last about 5-7 hours. Which isn\'92t bad for a PC.\
\
Another benefit is that this laptop comes with a ton of ports on it and doesn\'92t require additional dongles like the new Macs. If you were to purchase the same laptop configuration at most retailers (Best Buy, hhgregg, bhphotovideo) you\'92d pay upwards of $900-$1,200. If you have no trust in installing the software you could also pay some tech person $100-$200 to set up the system for you.\
\
For a work computer or college computer I\'92d diffidently recommend this for someone on a budget. It\'92s not super portable and doesn\'92t look sleek, but it will do the job.}
