I really,really wanted to like this Chromebook. I did a lot of research, reading about the good and bad, but I made the plunge. It is an attractive device and I like the build quality. My issues with the device far outweigh its looks. When switching to tablet mode, which I realize will be far different than say an iPad, the device lags. I installed the Netflix app from the Playstore and when scrolling the screen jumps back and forth. Two other apps I installed (Facebook and Yahoo mail) failed to work at all. Finally, the wifi range of this device is the worst of any that I have ever tried in my house.

I feel like I bought a device that was still in beta testing, not ready for Prime time. I've returned it and will wait to see what the market brings next. I simply can't recommend this device.
