After extensive research, I chose this model laptop. I have had it about a month and so far find it to be exactly what I wanted in a laptop. I watched many videos and read a lot of reviews but in the end, I am pleased with this so far.\
I purchased this mainly because I wanted my own laptop for years and years and finally had enough money to afford something decent. I set it up following the online guidelines I read by Googling a few sites (you can just put in how to set up a laptop) and see what results work for you.\
\
Out of the box it plugged in and did need some time to patch and get ready but most of my time was spent adding anti-spyware, downloading anti-virus and so forth. Take your time and spend those first hours getting your computer ready to work optimally and you will be good to go.\
\
This next part is for SIMS 3 PLAYERS if you play that and need some user advice regarding this laptop--\
\
I am a modest gamer (Sims 2, 3, and now 4) are my go to games. I was playing Sims 2 on our 7 year old Toshiba but it could not handle Sims 3 very well and I really love that game, so I am pleased to say this computer (right now) can run Sims 3 base game, Ambitions,Late Night and Seasons so far. I might add on University (I was really unable to play it on my old system) or Generations. I have a modest amount of CC but after downloading a house with HEAVY CC I was not able to move around very easily in build mode. So yeah, if you have Sims 4 and a few EPS you will be fine. Just remember it's old CC or detailed stuff that can bog down your system. Sims 4 runs well but I haven't spent much time on that with this PC yet.\
\
The only negatives I have right now are:\
\
1) The screen is attached on to the base by only 2 clips. If these break or snap off I am not sure what I can do! Someone told me that happened to one of their Acer computers.\
\
2) There is no way this is a 12 hour battery. Maybe if you surf or do low level work but when I play The Sims 3 it eats battery life. I just keep it plugged in as I didn't buy this to lug around but more as an at home unit.\
\
3) I'm concerned because the disc drive (where you stick in games/dvds) isn't as responsive as on other computers I've had. Sometimes I have to push the button a few times for it to close or for the computer to acknowledge my game.\
\
Hopefully this review helped some of you decide on whether or not to purchase this model PC. Like I said, I recommend hitting some video sites and watching some physical reviews.}
