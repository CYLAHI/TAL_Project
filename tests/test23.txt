First let me say that I love Chromebooks in general. I have owned several of them: Acers, an earlier Samsung, Toshiba, etc. It's a wonderful platform and I recommend them highly. However, the Samsung Plus has been the worst of all of the Chromebooks that I have owned, unfortunately.

It has been the most troublesome, from a hardware standpoint, compared to any of the earlier Chromebooks. It crashes regularly; at least once a day. It just shuts off and reboots. While rebooting itself is fairly quick, it takes a long time to reload my Chrome tabs. The shutdowns seem to be random: at one point if I close a tab it will crash, at another point if I just click on web page it will crash. It does run apps okay, some better than others of course, but in general I have not found the apps to be incredibly useful. The native capabilities of a Chromebook are good enough to where the apps are not something that I find incredibly useful so far. The other thing that I find annoying is the flip part of this design. Yes, you can make it tent, or make it be in tablet mode, but there is really no good place to hold the computer while doing this. If you try and grasp it by one of the upper corners you can close the Chrome browser, which is very irritating because you have to reboot the computer to get your tabs back; if you just reopen the Chrome browser you're presented with a blank tab and all of your previously open tabs, while in history, are no longer displayed. Also, when in tablet mode if you try to pick up the computer or grasp it you have to pretty much touch the screen, which can cause all sorts of unintended havoc. So for the next Chromebook that I get I think that I will forgo the flip part of the design because it really doesn't add that much and can make the computer very irritating to operate. Also I find that the computer is not particularly fast. I realize that part of this is that I don't have a broadband connection, just an ADSL connection, so it may be better if you are connected to a much faster service provider than I'm able to acquire. I do like the the precision of the pen and think it’s one of the best things about this model. The metal case looks nice and “premium” when new, but it does dent rather than just deflect like the plastic cases do, so that it looks a bit beat up after just a couple of months.

Overall I do not think that this is quite ready for primetime, at least not for me. The premium cost is not really justified in my situation and I rather regret this purchase.
