We have several of these LG laptops at our office. They are amazing light. The keyboard is not that great but usable. The trackpad is terrible. You're definitely going want to get a good external mouse. Otherwise, we have not had any issues and they have stood up well to employee abuse. We are not purchasing the 15" versions which have a much larger screen and better keyboard and they still weigh the same as the 14" versions. The trackpads are still junk.We have several of these LG laptops at our office. They are amazing light. The keyboard is not that great but usable. The trackpad is terrible.
