im really satisfied with the product. compact and portable, its perfect for carrying around. i only use it for everday tasks such as youtubing, web surfing and watching vidoes and needless to say the specs are more than sufficient. however there are a few areas where improvements could be made. my biggest disappointment was the noise of the fan. multitasking seems to be a challenge for the fan as it starts to spin furiously for a while with even a few chrome tabs opened simultaneously. its not the quietest notebook and if fan noise is something that bothers you this notebook isnt for you. battery life is not very impressive either, clocking in at 3-4 hrs. lastly it would be nice if the keyboard was backlit. that said, the above issues aren't deal breakers and im more than satisfied with the product.
