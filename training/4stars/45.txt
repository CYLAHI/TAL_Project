This laptop is marketed towards the mediocre user that uses their laptop for office processing, media consumption, and general browsing. Anything other than the aforementioned would result in the laptop venting and the while underside and top half of the keyboard to get hot. The price for this laptop is very justifiable considering the resolution, screen size, portability (size and weight), and ease of use. There is no bloat ware on the computer and it has a nice chiclet style keyboard that feels similar to macbooks. Battery life is enough for around 5 hours of on and off use of the internet, but maybe more if you are doing less demanding tasks.
