So far, really impressed. My ultimate goal was to find a well-reviewed laptop that was lightweight, but did not want to sacrifice ports.

I had my eye on the Asus Zenbook 3. It looked like a high performance and sleek machine (if I'm spending a chunk of change, I would hope that it would feel worth the money). However, my existing work machine crapped out before the Zenbook 3 became available. I liked the Asus Zenbook series overall and ended up going with the Asus Zenbook 305UA. I had the machine for 2 days, and encountered a few issues, so I ended up returning it and continuing my research.

Stumbled upon the LG Gram. I was initially turned off by the "meh" battery, but it had everything else I was looking for - weight, specs, and ports - so I went for it. It was a little more than I intended to spend but overall I'm glad I did.

The Good:
- Screen: Screen blows away a lot of PC laptops. The 15 inch size is really helpful when using the machine for business. Resolution is excellent.
- Weight: Super, SUPER lightweight.
- Keyboard: Others noted issues with the keyboard but I've used it for a few weeks now as an every-day work machine and have zero problems. I find it perfectly comfortable to type with.
- Ports: LG nailed it. 3 USB 2.0/3.0 ports, 1 USBC, and a standard HDMI. Only adapter I need is a USB-Ethernet adapter (when necessary) and I'm good to go. Really happy with these.
- Performance: Use the machine daily for work, and have had no issues with speed. So far so great.
- Reader mode: I didn't even realize the laptop had this feature when I bought it, but I turned it on and haven't gone back. Really helps the eyes when looking at the screen for extended periods of time.

The "Bad":
- Battery: Probably #1 drawback on this laptop. I haven't done extensive battery tests, but it looks like I would normally run 5-6 hours tops. Pretty weak, considering I've used a Macbook air for years with a good 8-10 hours of battery.
- This is a little hard to complain about, but - its almost a little too light. It kindof feels like there's nothing in it, which is great when carrying it around, but it feels a little fragile. If I hold it one-handed from one side it feels like it'll almost (almost, not quite) bend. Overall not a major complaint.
- Trackpad: It's just "ok." But honestly, I don't think there's a PC out there that really nails the trackpad. Say what you want about Apple, but they sure as heck have a great trackpad.

Ultimately, it's a great PC and you can't go wrong. Marked 4 stars really only due to the sub-par battery.

**EDIT:**
Forgot to mention another con: speakers. The speakers are really mediocre. I've found I have to turn the volume up all the way to hear much, especially if the laptop isn't on a hard service.

One other comment, I haven't had the same issue others have experienced with the power jack. In fact, I've almost experienced the opposite - it's quite difficult to unplug. Hoping it stays that way!
