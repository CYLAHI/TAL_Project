Some people trying to compare MacBook Air to this LG but they're forgetting about the price tag, LG cost $658 and MacBook $999.
MacBook has the best battery life and best touch pad and you can't compare those two with any other computer on the market, but i use Windows since 1998 and my MacBook Air operating system drive me crazy .
Because of that I got this Lg 13.3 128 Gb a few days ago ,
It's very small and light , looks like 11 inch screen laptop with great design. So far it's the best laptop for my needs. Battery life is around 5h .
