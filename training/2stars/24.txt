Laptop is extremely lightweight, boots quickly and checks most of the boxes of what I was looking for at this price point.
Wifi performance is poor and I continue to have bluetooth issues.
I've attempted to contact Asus support for troubleshooting beyond what they originally sent (which was a copy/pasted troubleshooting guide), but have had no luck on the official Asus site as well as Twitter.

Proceed with caution. If you have a bad experience, Asus support may not be there to help.
