Bought this in April 2016. Liked it. It wasn't perfect but a very reliable machine.
Until a few weeks ago, after 10 months being my go-to computer, it started crashing by itself, over and over. I always got the blue screen with error "critical process died." It could crash at any random time. Sometimes it crashed right after I turned it on. The screen froze a lot too. The computer heats up more often. None of these problems existed before. I really cannot tell if it's a hardware issue or Windows 10's updates. Somebody help??

I'm a college student. I bought the 13.3" one so that I have less to carry around campus everyday. However, the battery life isn't that good (which was no surprise considering how light it is), definitely won't hold up to 10 hours. Under the way I use it (writing homework, browsing webpages, simple programming), it lasts about 5 hours. So Take Note!
Sometimes I have a long school day, I need to bring its charger to feel safe, and the charger is almost as heavy as the computer lollll. Since I just bought it, who knows how much worse the battery would be in a year.
