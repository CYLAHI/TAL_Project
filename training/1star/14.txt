MADE IN CHINA! The charger connection is tiny and was cracked where inserted into the computer. It was close to breaking so I called Samsung USA. Guess what, they say this was made in China and not USA. So in order to have China warranty to look at the power cord, I would have to mail the entire computer and cord to a service center they designate at my cost. Same for anything that goes wrong with it. I saved $100 by buying it from Amazon instead of Samsung USA believing it was from the US as stated. It says on the Amazon advertisement and warranty Samsung USA! The warranty service number on Amazon goes to a foreign country. If it had been made in the USA, Samsung would have mailed me a new charger. I was not about to mail my computer off, so I had to purchase an additional charger at my cost. I will buy direct the next time.
