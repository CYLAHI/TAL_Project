The laptop is sleek and fast. My low rating is due to the battery life. The advertised life is up to 12 hours. I was hoping for half of that amount. I am not a power user and basically surf the web and do email. I am very lucky to get 3 hours.

The Samsung customer service is not good. I gave them the serial number but the unit is not in their system. My Amazon order number was apparently not enough. I am traveling so do not have the time or printer to print and scan the original order number. The kind people at Samsung said the fix would take 14 days. I asked if I could pay for expedited service (at least the shipping) and they said no. This is my only PC so 14 days in not an option.
