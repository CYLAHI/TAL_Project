Webcam placement makes online communication awkward to impossible. Otherwise, this would have probably been a great computer. I started with an ASUS Zenbook last year, which I loved, but was literally ONE day out of warranty and the motherboard was fried...was going to order another Zenbook but many of the ultrabook types have more RAM/better processor etc. So I ordered the Samsung Notebook 9 Spin. Which would have been a great notebook, BUT I am getting less than 3 hours of battery life, so that's a no-go. Onto the LG Gram...the webcam is in the middle of the hinge. If you use the laptop close to your body it gives an awkward view of you, but acceptable. However, I tutor on-line and use an attached drawing tablet for the math problems, so I have to scoot the laptop further away from me. You could barely see the top of my head. Also, I use it for students who remotely join a live science class, and I typically tilt the screen down so the camera points at what we're working on...not possible with the crazy placement on this camera. I also found some of the Lenovo have this hinge placement for the camera. I have ordered now an Asus Q324 UA, from Best Buy, as Amazon has it only available from other sellers who were priced more than the $950 at BB. Hopefully, this will finally be the one...If battery life isn't important to you, then the Samsung Spin 9 is great. If webcam isn't important to you, then the LG Gram was probably fine too. Hopefully this helps others from getting this machine if they work with the webcam.
