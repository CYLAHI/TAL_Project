I’m in love with the device, however I must express my sincerely disappointed feeling on the prices, I purchase it on Saturday 17th of April and I received on Wednesday 20th, however the day that I purchase it I had a chat with a representative on the Samsung webpage stating that the price just changed for about 30 mins of the moment that I reviewed it, I just move to the bank to deposit the amount requested and went I got back home the price was higher for 80 USD, however now it says that it got a 100 USD off from the original price which it was 2 days away from the day I purchased it. I can’t believe Samsung did that to us, customers, I’ve been a customer of Samsung devices from almost 3 to 4 years now and never had just a bad experience such as this. They argued with me stating that prices may vary, however this time I was the one who got punk'd by them. I’m not referring myself to the devices as such bad decision however, when it comes to the prices, it is not fair that they made me spent 100 USD more when 2 days later they lower the price. I might have considered buying an Apple product since, they prices may not vary that much. I can only say that I’m very disappointed and I might consider buying more of your products in the future. You can go ahead and review my devices registered with you and you will see that you guys lose a potential customer.
