I am a big fan of LG laptops. I used LG ultrabook before, and I recently bought this LG gram.
I like it pretty much.
But the mousepad moves on its own. It jumps around on the screen and clicks on its own.
I cannot concentrate on my work!!!
I think I should get it repaired...but the seller does not reply to me. Where can I get it fixed for free??
I bought it last week and it came on Monday. (yesterday)
I didn't do anything wrong on it!
