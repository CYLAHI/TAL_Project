First time buying SAMSUNG laptop, first seen this beauty in CES 2016 and it completely drew my attention.
Let's talk battery, it's bad, I've devised a few tests on it
1) playing youtube videos at 1080p at 34% brightness, it lasted 5 hours and 40 minutes, wifi on, Bluetooth off, battery savor mode off, Airplane mode off
2) doing online homework and using it in class for online reading materials, brightness at 50%, it lasted around 5 hours, wifi on, Bluetooth off, battery savor mode off, Airplane mode off

Speakers, it's actually okey for a laptop of this size

screen, it's a 1080p panel and SAMSUNG did a great job of dealing with reflection on the screen, good time!

Keyboard, I enjoy typing on it more than I expected. I've tried the keyboard on the 2lb MacBook, and I didn't like it because the key travel is just awful

Build quality, it almost kind of feel a bit plastic no matter where you touch

Weight, no doubt it's my favorite part, incredibly light, good stuff

Backlight keyboard, very easy and restful on the eyes, good job SAMSUNG

Objectively, it's a terrible laptop considered it's promised battery life, I think it is the only I don't like about this laptop
