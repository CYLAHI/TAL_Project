Very lightweight, yet heavy enough not to be pushed around as you type with a screen that seems so much more legible than an 11.6" unit. I added a microsd 200GB memory for storing data (never store it on internal drive). It doesn't stick out from the laptop body, IR micro mouse (which only sticks out 1/8") and got a mobile hotspot for it and take it wherever I go! LOVE IT!
