The Gram is a great addition to the ultrabook field. It is one of the only Ultrabooks to come in 14". The screen looks fantatsic ( but is not a touch. ) It is as vibrant and clear as any macbook. The whole laptop looks and feels higj quality.. The newer XPS and HP envys in Best Buy just felt like junk compared to this.
The Intel i5 with the ssd is faster than I expected for such a low power machine. It is much faster than my old yoga 3 pro, and holds great battery life. The aeathetics are great in the champagne color too. This laptop is the best value for under 1k.

If I find a downside, I'll be sure to update my post.
