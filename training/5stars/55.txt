I use this laptop for college. Carrying a laptop around all day means that it has to be lightweight and this one is the lightest of them all. Even the macbook air feels much heavier. This computer works fine for typing documents, watching videos and surfing the web (pretty much all I use it for). Battery life is decent. I use it between classes and do not have to bring the charger. My only complaints are that the screen is sometimes creeky when closing it and the keyboard is not backlit. That being said, the lightness of the laptop is the most important factor for me so I am happy with this purchase. I did purchase the square trade insurance just in case.
