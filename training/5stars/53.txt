I ordered Lenovo's lop top recently but returned it due to many reason especially monitor problem (Blinking in three day after purchase). Since I returned Lenovo laptop, I searched several days. And then I finally find out LG gram which meet our requirement, light (2lb), thin, reasonable CPU speed, design, white color, etc. Since I used it, I loooooove it. It is really nice and good touch compare to any other lap top (Lenovo) that I use for my work, and two HP laptops in my home. This is wonderful lap top. Very light. I will buy carrier bag for this laptop since I don't want to hurt this beautiful one.
